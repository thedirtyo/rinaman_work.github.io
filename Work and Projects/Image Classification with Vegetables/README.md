Image classification is starting to take off in all parts of our lives.  When I started this analysis, I found it very difficult to find a large number of pictures to classify.  The only dataset I could find was a collection of vegetables.  It sounds strange classifying vegetables, but that is not the point.  All of the concepts of image classification are used in this analysis.  I was able to create a neural network model that could classify vegetables with a very high accuracy.  Please take a few minutes and go over my paper and code to see of you can learn something new!


This analysis used the Python programming language.
