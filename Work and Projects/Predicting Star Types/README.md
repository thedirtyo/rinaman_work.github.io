Over the last few years, I have grown to be a very large fan of Elon Musk.  Not because of his Tesla ventures, but his space ventures.  Space is the last frontier and Elon has turned me into a space fanatic.  I found a unique dataset on Kaggle that contained variables related to star types.  Using some exploratory data analysis and some predictive modeling I was able to create a model that could predict a stars type with 80% accuracy.

Variables used to predict Star Type:
- Temperature
- Relative Luminosity
- Relative Radius
- Absolute Magnitude
- Color
- Spectral Class

Predictive Model Technique: 
- KNN

For this analysis I used the Python programming language.
