Wouldn't we all like to be as rich and successful as Warren Buffet?  During the last few years, I have grown a strong interest in the stock market and how it works.  I was curious one day and wondered if it could be possible to predict when the market would go up or down?  Due to time contraints I could not investigate the entire market, but I decideded to narrow it down to one of the more famous indicators of the market the S&P500.  For decades people have been trying to beat the market trying to time it just right to make a fortune.  For my project my goal was to determine if an accurate model can be created to predict the performance of the S&P500 index.  The outcome the models will be predicting is if the index will either rise or fall next month.  Having the advantage of knowing how the index will perform is a huge advantage when it comes to investing.  An accurate model could prove to be highly valuable.   The data I will be using to develop the model will be from many of the lead indicators economists use to try and understand the market.
