For one of my projects we were tasked with a fictional issue of media companies bashing the safety of the airline industry.  I decided to go explore the web looking for datasets to prove this false.  The analysis actually showed that air travel is not only safe, but one of the safest modes of transportation.  The data also showed that air travel related incidents and death were both trending down over the last few decades.  

There is no code for this project, all of the visualization in the presentation were created using Tableau.
