In this analysis, I wanted to see if in fact homefield advantage was real.  My hypothesis was that since the begining of the pandemic, most sports arenas were left to have sporting events with little to no fans.  I compared stats of games and investigated if any of the stats were significantly different under covid-19 compared to years prior.  For the analysis I am using the NFL dataset from Kaggle.  Some of the results are suprisingly interesting.  The code for the project is in the the document attached in this folder.  Please take a few minutes to read through the document.

The R programming lanugage was used for this analysis.
