Strokes are the second leading cause of death in the United States and 3rd leading cause of death in the world.  The question I presented to myself was what if we could predict if someone could have a stroke by using some of their health charactoristics?  Kaggle just so happened to have a data set of just that.  The data set contained health charactoristics of a few thousand patients.  Using that data I performed an exploratory data analysis and then used insights from the analysis to build a predictive model.  Although the model did not perform the best, it was still an interesting project and I urge all to take a few minutes to review the code and presentation
